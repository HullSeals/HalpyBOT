# HalpyBOT DSSA spreadsheet scraper tool

# Description
CLI for reading, parsing, and converting the official FleetComm DSSA spreadsheet into a JSON file

# Installation

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- BeautifulSoup4 Python Library
- Requests Python Library
- TQDM Python Library
- Pyperclip Python Library
- LXML Python Library

## Troubleshooting
- This tool relies on the spreadsheet layout being the same as it was in early September 2021 in order to work correctly.
Because of the semi-informal nature of this spreadsheet, and the obvious lack of any public guidelines that require
  consistency therein, this tool may need to be rewritten should the spreadsheet be changed dramatically.
